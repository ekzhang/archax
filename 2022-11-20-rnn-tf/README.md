# RNN

This is a basic RNN trained and compiled on the MNIST dataset.
Code was inspired by: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras

### Layers

Currently the model has two layers:
    - SimpleRNN (with dropout)
    - Dense layer (with softmax activation)

TODO: Add more layers if deemed necessary.
